Kubeglide Ingress is a lightweight, Kubernetes-native ingress solution built as a thin wrapper over the NGINX Ingress Controller.

# Kubeglide Ingress
Smooth Ingress, Effortless Flow

Kubeglide Ingress is an innovative, Kubernetes-native ingress controller designed to simplify and streamline your application traffic management. Built as a thin wrapper around the proven NGINX Ingress Controller, it delivers an out-of-the‑box experience that minimizes boilerplate, enhances dynamic configuration, and integrates seamlessly with modern IaC tools like Terraform and Helm.

Why Kubeglide Ingress?
In our experience with Traefik and NGINX Ingress, we identified several common pain points—complex configuration, disruptive reloads, and a steep learning curve when integrating with infrastructure as code. Kubeglide Ingress is our response to these challenges, aiming to:

Simplify Configuration: Provide a declarative, intuitive configuration layer that abstracts the underlying complexity.

Dynamic Updates: Enable zero-downtime configuration updates and dynamic service discovery.

IaC-Friendly: Seamlessly integrate with Terraform, Helm, and other automation tools to support repeatable and portable deployments.

Future-Ready: Lay the groundwork for advanced features like one‑click GPU workload deployments and migration-friendly cluster setups.

Key Features
Zero-Config Mode: Preconfigured defaults to get you started quickly.

Dynamic Service Discovery: Automatically updates routes based on Kubernetes service changes.

Integrated TLS Management: Works with cert-manager for automatic certificate provisioning.

IaC Integration: Designed with infrastructure state management in mind—perfect for Terraform and Helm deployments.

Modular Architecture: A thin wrapper that leverages the stability of NGINX Ingress while exposing high-level configuration options.

Planned GPU Support: Roadmap includes streamlined GPU workload deployments for ML and other compute‑intensive applications.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
A Kubernetes cluster (managed, bare‑metal, or hybrid).

kubectl configured for your cluster.

Helm (optional for installation via Helm charts).

Familiarity with YAML configuration.

Installation Options
You can either install Kubeglide Ingress as a standalone controller or use our Helm chart for automated deployments. (Instructions to be provided in detail.)

Example
yaml
Copy
apiVersion: kubeglide.ingress/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: my-app-ingress
spec:
  host: "app.example.com"
  tls:
    enabled: true
    certManager: true
  service:
    name: my-app-service
    port: 80
This example shows a simple ingress route with TLS enabled via cert-manager.

Contributing
We welcome contributions, discussions, and ideas to shape the future of Kubeglide Ingress. Whether you have suggestions for new features, improvements to existing functionality, or ideas to enhance the developer experience, we want to hear from you!

Issues: Please open an issue for bug reports, feature requests, or questions.

Pull Requests: Contributions are encouraged! Fork the repository and submit a PR.

Discussions: Join our GitHub Discussions (or Discord channel) to share ideas and collaborate with other developers.

Roadmap: We are actively refining our roadmap. Check out the ROADMAP.md (to be created) for planned features and milestones.

Repository Management Suggestions
Repository Structure: Rather than forking directly from the NGINX Ingress repository, we recommend starting a new repository. This approach allows us to cleanly separate our thin wrapper layer from the upstream NGINX Ingress while still tracking updates as a dependency (via submodules or Helm dependencies).

Upstream Collaboration: Consider contributing upstream improvements back to the NGINX Ingress project where applicable. This can help ensure compatibility and reduce duplicate work.

Documentation & Examples: Invest in comprehensive documentation and example configurations to ease adoption.

Community Engagement: Use GitHub Discussions and integrate with community channels (like a Slack or Discord server) to foster an open dialogue about feature priorities and use cases.
